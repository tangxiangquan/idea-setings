      <item value="Converts the given Table into a DataStream of add and retract messages. The message will be encoded as Tuple2. The first field is a Boolean flag, the second field holds the record of the specified type T. A true Boolean flag indicates an add message, a false flag indicates a retract message. The fields of the Table are mapped to DataStream fields as follows: Row and org.apache.flink.api.java.tuple.Tuple types: Fields are mapped by position, field types must match. POJO DataStream types: Fields are mapped by field name, field types must match. Deprecated Use toChangelogStream(Table, Schema) instead. It integrates with the new type system and supports all kinds of DataTypes and every ChangelogMode that the table runtime can produce. Params: table – The Table to convert. clazz – The class of the requested record type. Type parameters: &lt;T&gt; – The type of the requested record type. Returns: The converted DataStream." />
      <item value="Sets the Blink planner as the required module. This is the default behavior. Deprecated The old planner has been removed in Flink 1.14. Since there is only one planner left (previously called the 'blink' planner), this setting is obsolete and will be removed in future versions." />
